# In Class Problem Set 3

I used ComboBoxDemo.java a while ago.  It used to work.  Even though the code has not changed, it now  will not compile.

Doing everything from a command prompt or Git Bash (no IDEs allowed), your mission is to debug the code and find out why it stopped working.  When you have figured it out,  note what you changed and why it stopped working in the README.md file.
